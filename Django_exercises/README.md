## Prerequisites

Before installing Django, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed (Refer to the [Python Installation Guide](https://github.com/Axlfc/python3-course/blob/master/README.md) for installation instructions).
- Pip package manager installed (Usually comes with Python by default).

## Windows Installation

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Create a new directory for your Django project (optional).
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project (if applicable).
4. Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Command Prompt:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - PowerShell:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
6. Continue with the [Installing Django](#installing-django) section.

## GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) Installation

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create a new directory for your Django project (optional).
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project (if applicable).
4. Install the virtual environment package by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```
5. Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.
6. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
7. Continue with the [Installing Django](#installing-django) section.

## macOS Installation

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create a new directory for your Django project (optional).
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project (if applicable).
4. Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
6. Continue with the [Installing Django](#installing-django) section.

## Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project (if not already there).
3. Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

## Installing Django

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - GNU/Linux or macOS:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
2. Use pip to install Django by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install django
   ```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify the Django installation, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   python -m django --version
   ```
   This command will display the installed Django version.

## File Explanations

- **manage.py**: This file is automatically created when you start a Django project using the `django-admin startproject` command. It is a command-line utility that provides various functionalities, such as running development servers, performing database migrations, and running tests.

- **settings.py**: This file is located within the project directory and contains the configuration settings for your Django project. You can define database settings, static file paths, middleware, and other project-specific configurations in this file.

- **urls.py**: This file is located within the project directory and contains URL patterns for your Django project. It maps URLs to specific views or endpoints within your application.

- **views.py**: This file is located within the Django app directory and defines the views or functions that handle HTTP requests and generate responses. Views render templates, process form data, and perform other application logic.

- **models.py**: This file is located within the Django app directory and defines the data models for your application. Models represent database tables, and you can define fields, relationships, and methods associated with the models.

- **admin.py**: This file is located within the Django app directory and is used for registering models with the Django admin interface. The admin interface provides a convenient way to manage and interact with data stored in the database.

- **forms.py**: This file is located within the Django app directory and contains form classes. Forms define the fields and validation rules for collecting data from users.

- **static/**: This directory, located within the Django app directory, is used for storing static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- **templates/**: This directory, located within the Django app directory, is used for storing HTML templates that define the structure and layout of your application's pages.

## Common Django Commands

Here are some common Django commands used in Django development:

- `django-admin startproject <project_name>`: Creates a new Django project with the given name. This command creates the project's directory structure and necessary files.

- `python3 manage.py startapp <app_name>`: Creates a new Django app within the project. An app is a self-contained module that houses related functionality of the project.

- `python3 manage.py runserver`: Starts the Django development server, allowing you to test and view your Django application in a local environment.

- `python3 manage.py runserver <port>`: Starts the Django development server on a specific port. By default, the server runs on port 8000, but you can specify a different port if needed.

- `python3 manage.py makemigrations`: Creates new database migration files based on the changes made to your Django models.

- `python3 manage.py migrate`: Applies any pending database migrations, updating the database schema to match the current state of your Django models.

- `python3 manage.py migrate <app_name>`: Applies any pending database migrations for a specific Django app. This command updates the database schema for the specified app based on the changes made to its models.

- `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`: Creates a superuser account for accessing the Django admin site. The superuser has administrative privileges.

- `python3 manage.py collectstatic`: Collects all static files from your apps into a single location, which can be served by a web server in production.

- `python3 manage.py test`: Runs the tests defined in your Django project. Tests help ensure the correctness of your application's functionality.

- `python3 manage.py shell`: Starts a Python interactive shell with Django preloaded. This allows you to interact with your project's models and perform database queries.

- `python3 manage.py shell_plus`: Starts an enhanced Python interactive shell with Django and other third-party packages preloaded. This command provides additional features and shortcuts compared to the default shell.

- `python3 manage.py shell_plus --notebook`: Starts a Jupyter Notebook interface with Django and other third-party packages preloaded. This allows you to interact with your Django project and perform data analysis or experiments using a notebook environment.

- `python3 manage.py flush`: Resets the database and removes all data from it. Use this command with caution as it permanently deletes all records from the database.

- `python3 manage.py makemessages --all`: Creates or updates translation files (.po) for all apps in your project, based on the marked translation strings in the code.

- `python3 manage.py compilemessages`: Compiles the translation files (.po) into binary format (.mo) for use in your Django application.

- `python manage.py help`: For general help.

- `python manage.py command_name -h`: For command-specific help.
